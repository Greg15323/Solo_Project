This final project was built using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB. 
The App is called "Glimpse" and it is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives with the ability to like delete those posts.

This app is mobile and tablet friendly!

Soon to come will be login capabilities.
